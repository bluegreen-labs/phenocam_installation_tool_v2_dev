> [!warning]
> Due to the Internet-of-Things (IoT) nature of the code of the Phenocam Installation Tool (PIT) BlueGreen Labs (BV), as a small software developer, is forced to open this code to avoid costly litigation under the European Commission [Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act) should a user mess up and a device is used as a mallware vector. This code is therefore "open source" under a [CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/), and uses a very narrow interpretation of open souce.

> This means that you are **free to read the content** to ensure no malicious actions are taken on your network, to be in compliance with the CRA. BlueGreen Labs (BV) therefore will not accept any liability in case abuse facilitated through camera devices. The license used is also as restrictive as possible due to the considerable time invested on part of BlueGreen Labs (BV). Generarlly, no other practical use cases are permitted outside the scope of the PhenoCam network without formal consent. Please consult BlueGreen Labs (BV) for custom applications. Please support small software developers/consultants.
